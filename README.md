# Vintage Bonfires

A Vintage Story mod that adds bonfires to the game.

Continued from [Bonfires](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bonfires) original idea by [Zarkonnen](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/user/3A823AFC2B0FB0879692).*)

This version has been updated to work with 1.21.x. The code has been largely rewritten, and while it appears to work, it still needs a fair bit of refactoring and tidying up.
**Use with care in worlds you actually care about until version 1.0.0 releases.**

## Description
Rediscover the ancient art of fire-setting! This mod introduces bonfires, a powerful primitive tool designed to assist with early-game mining and rock-breaking by harnessing the power of thermal shock.
Based on the real-world historical technique, Vintage Bonfires allows you to build a large, intense fire against a rock face. The prolonged, extreme heat weakens the stone, causing it to crack and become brittle. This makes difficult stone easier to mine or even shatters it completely, saving you tool durability and time.
Perfect for the early-game prospector, Vintage Bonfires provides a satisfying and realistic step between your first stone tools and the age of metal. Use the environment to your advantage and master the techniques of the ancients!

Or you can just light one in the town-center and look at it.

## Features
- Fire-Setting Mechanic: Build a bonfire next to solid rock or ore veins. When the fire burns out, the intense heat will crack the adjacent stone. Cracked ore and rock is one tier easier to mine, allowing you to access valuable resources sooner with lower-tier tools.
- Shatter Rock: Don't want to waste your pickaxe on solid rock? Apply a second bonfire to an already cracked block to shatter it completely, breaking it into its stone or ore drops.
- A Cosy Bonfire: Once lit, the bonfire acts as a long-lasting heat and light source, perfect for a temporary base camp or a town square.
- Integration with the [Real Smoke mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/realsmoke) I NEED HELP WITH THIS! If anyone can look at my patch to see why no smoke is produced?

## How to Use Your Bonfire
1. Craft a Bonfire Base from the handbook (recipe: 3x Firewood, 3x Sticks).
2. Place the base on the ground, directly adjacent to the rock or ore you wish to crack.
3. Add 3 Firewood one by one to build the bonfire up to its full size.
4. Add more Firewood to fuel the bonfire. It can hold up to 32 pieces.
5. Light the bonfire with a torch or firestarter.
6. Wait for the fire to burn out. The process takes time!
7. Collect your rewards! The adjacent rock and ore will now be cracked.
8. (Optional) Apply a second bonfire to the cracked blocks to break them completely without using a pickaxe.

## Planned Features
- Configuration option to prevent monster spawning within a set radius while lit
  (possibly animals too, we’ll see)
- Either remove coal ores from breaking mechanic or make them combustible?

I’m fairly new to Vintage Story modding, so I used AI as a code-checking and learning aid. **It did not (re)write the mod**, it merely helped me understand what I was doing.
