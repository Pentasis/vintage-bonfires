# Vintage Bonfires

A Vintage Story mod that adds bonfires to the game.

Continued from [Bonfires](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bonfires) original idea by [Zarkonnen](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/user/3A823AFC2B0FB0879692).*)

This version has been updated to work with 1.21.x. The code has been largely rewritten, and while it appears to work, it still needs a fair bit of refactoring and tidying up.
**Use with care in worlds you actually care about until version 1.0.0 releases.**

## Features
- A Cosy Bonfire: Once lit, the bonfire acts as a long-lasting heat and light source, perfect for a temporary basecamp or a town square. It burns 4x longer than a regular fire.
- [Fire-Setting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-setting) Mechanic: Build a bonfire next to solid rock or ore veins. When the fire burns out, the intense heat will crack the adjacent stone. Cracked ore and rock is one tier easier to mine, allowing you to access valuable resources sooner with lower-tier tools.
- Shatter Rock: Don't want to waste your pickaxe on solid rock? Apply a second bonfire to an already cracked block to shatter it completely, breaking it into its stone or ore drops.
- Integration with the [Real Smoke mod](https://mods.vintagestory.at/realsmoke).

## How to Use Your Bonfire
1. Craft a Bonfire Base from the handbook.
2. Place the base on the ground, directly adjacent to the rock or ore you wish to crack.
3. Add 3x 4 Firewood to build the bonfire up to its full size (building a bonfire takes 12 firewood total).
4. Add more Firewood to fuel the bonfire. It can hold up to 32 pieces but for cracking you only need 1.
5. Light the bonfire with a torch or firestarter.
6. Wait for the fire to burn out. The process takes time!
7. Collect your rewards! The directly(!) adjacent rock and ore will now be cracked.
8. (Optional) Apply a second bonfire to the cracked blocks to break them completely without using a pickaxe.

## Planned Features (Will decide based on feedback)
- Either remove coal ores from the  fire-settings mechanic or make them combustible?
- Option to prevent monsters and animals from spawning and make them keep distance within a radius while lit?
- Add config-file with option for burn-time?

I’m fairly new to Vintage Story modding, so I used AI as a code-checking and learning aid. **It did not (re)write the mod**, it merely helped me understand what I was doing and added comments where needed.
