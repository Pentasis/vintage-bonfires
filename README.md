# Bonfires Return

A *Vintage Story* mod that adds bonfires back into the game.

Continued from [Bonfires](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bonfires) original idea by [Zarkonnen](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/user/3A823AFC2B0FB0879692).*)

This version has been updated to work with 1.21.x. The code has been largely rewritten, and while it appears to work, it still needs a fair bit of refactoring and tidying up.
**Use with care in worlds you actually care about.**

I’m fairly new to Vintage Story modding, so I used AI as a code-checking and learning aid. **It did not (re)write the mod**, it merely helped me understand what I was doing. Apparently, this now needs stating out loud.

## Planned Features

* Configuration option to disable ore cracking
* Configuration option to prevent monster spawning within a set radius while lit
  (possibly animals too, we’ll see)
* Compatibility with *Real Smoke*
  (help welcome if anyone fancies it)

*) The original mod was released under the CC0 1.0 Universal licence (which I continue), which is extremely permissive. I still asked the original author for permission but haven’t received a reply yet. If they ever wish to continue their own mod, I will remove this one without fuss.
