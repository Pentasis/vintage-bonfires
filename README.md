# Bonfires return

Vintage Story mod that adds bonfires.

Continued from [Bonfires](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bonfires) by [Zarkonnen](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/user/3A823AFC2B0FB0879692), with their permission.
(Forked from https://github.com/Zarkonnen/VSBonfires).

For now I updated the mod so it works in 1.21.x and removed the cracked ore ability for now (I didn't like it, but I may be persuaded to add it back in as an option. I also want to add some extra functionality in the future:

- Add a config-setting to prevent monsters spawning in a specified radius when lit.
- Add compatibility with Real Smoke (if anyone wants to help me with that; that would be great!)
