# Bonfires Return

A *Vintage Story* mod that adds bonfires back into the game.

Continued from [Bonfires](https://mods.vintagestory.at/bonfires) original idea by [Zarkonnen](https://mods.vintagestory.at/show/user/3A823AFC2B0FB0879692).*)

This version has been updated to work with 1.21.x. The code has been largely rewritten, and while it appears to work, it still needs a fair bit of refactoring and tidying up.
**Use with care in worlds you actually care about.**

I’m fairly new to Vintage Story modding, so I used AI as a code-checking and learning aid. **It did not (re)write the mod**, it merely helped me understand what I was doing. Apparently, this now needs stating out loud.

## Features:
- Adds a bonfire. Craft a base (in a grid). place it and add enough firewood, then light it. Once it burns out, you can rebuild it by adding firewood again.
- When placed on or near rock and/or ores, it will:
  - convert rock and ore into cracked-rock and cracked-ore with 1 mining tier lower than non-cracked.
  - break cracked rocks and cracked ores into stone/ore drops.
  This is a method of mining done in ancient times, called *fire-setting*.
- Bonfires burn firewood 4x longer than regular fires. (will be configurable in future)

## Planned Features

- Configuration option to disable ore cracking
- Configuration option to prevent monster spawning within a set radius while lit
  (possibly animals too, we’ll see)
- Compatibility with *Real Smoke*
  (help welcome if anyone fancies it)
- Either remove coal ores from breaking mechanic or make them combustible?

*) The original mod was released under the CC0 1.0 Universal licence (which I continue), which is extremely permissive. I still asked the original author for permission but haven’t received a reply yet. If they ever wish to continue their own mod, I will remove this one without fuss.
